# Agribot

The project proposes a versatile agricultural mobile robot designed to automate tasks such as measuring soil moisture, delivering water, planting seeds, and mowing grass. Utilizing an Arduino Nano computer, moisture sensors, and servo motors, the robot enhances irrigation efficiency by planting seeds at predetermined intervals and providing water to areas with low moisture levels. A smartphone application allows for remote management and live tracking of sensors. The paper provides an overview of the robotic system's design, components, methods, and experimental results, emphasizing its potential to address challenges in modern agriculture, such as labor scarcity and resource constraints. The technology employs a comprehensive approach, integrating hardware and software techniques to offer real-time monitoring and control. The prototype demonstrates improved efficiency and sustainability in agriculture through its innovative technology.
